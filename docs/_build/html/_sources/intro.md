#  Welcome to OpenAICG2+'s documentation


OpenAICG2+ is a Python package developed based on the OpenMM molecular simulation engine for running the AICG2+ (atom interation based coarse-grained) model. The AICG2+ model is a coarse-grained protein model constructed by Wenfei Li and others.
It is capable of describing biological processes such as protein folding and enzyme catalysis. Users can quickly create  AICG2+ models  using the API provided by this package.
